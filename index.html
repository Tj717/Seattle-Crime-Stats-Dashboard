            <!-- <h2>Project Introduction:</h2> -->
            <p>The project showcases an overview of crime rates and different types of crime within Seattle. In addition, it will provide a comprehensive view of police response coverage and the trend of criminal activities. This project aims to be a one-for-all infographic site that includes different customization options. The site gives users control over seeing what information they need and is looking for through interactive features.</p>
            <p>The primary function of the map is to generate and query different statistics from the dataset, such as crime records in 2022 or crimes against society. The primary data source is Seattle Open Data Portal's crime records dataset.</p>
